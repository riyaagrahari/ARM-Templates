- ARM Templates in Azure allows us to deploy multiple resources using a single declaractive template build upon JSON. The same template can be used for deploying resources with different parameters based upon user requirement. <br/>

- Provisioning and Managing infrastructure through code as well as performing automation on setting up our infrastructure in few moments of time is performed using these templates.

- This repository includes templates for deploying resources on azure like storage, virtual networks, sub-networks, Virtual Network Peering etc.

#### This repository contains code to provision resources (Resource Group, Virtual Network, Sub-Networks, Network Security Groups and Rules, Peering Connection) through ARM Templates in Azure.
